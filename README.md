# Machine Learning with a Perceptron (C++ Edition)

This little project is inspired by **Frank Rosenblatt’s 1958 Perceptron**, one of the very first machine learning models in history.

Instead of using Python or TensorFlow, this version is written from scratch in **C++**- just pure math, logic, and a dash of curiosity.

### What it does
- Learns to classify points as being on the **left** or **right** side (like Rosenblatt’s shape cards!)
- Adjusts its own weights with each epoch
- Prints its progress so you can *see* learning happen 

### How to run
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o perceptron
    ./perceptron

### Why I built this

I’m currently learning C++ and exploring machine learning fundamentals, and this project helped me understand how a neural network actually learns under the hood.

If you like this, feel free to fork it and tweak the dataset or logic.
